Bloink aims to reduce eye strain by reminding users to take frequent breaks to rest their eyes.  

Every 20 minutes, Bloink will remind the user to focus the eyes on things approximately 20 feet away for 20 seconds.  These rest breaks allow the eyes to refocus and are recommended by the American Optometric Association as an option to combat Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS).
